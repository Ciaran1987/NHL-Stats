# NHL-Stats

## Objective
Through data analysis and predictive modelling I attempt to predict NHL regular season game outcomes by utilizing opposing teams prior performance. Through the analysis I will investigate established key performance indicators and their use as predictors of team success?

## Data
NHL data is available via REST API from [https://statsapi.web.nhl.com](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com) a gitlab repository of all available endpoints and variables contained therein is available here: [https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi)

All available regular season game data points from the beginning of the 2010 season up to the early 2018 season were retrieved via the API.

I utilized pythons pandas, json and requests libraries to extract and transform game data from the NHL API for analysis and modelling

A variety of NHL data is available covering individual player and team stats, league standings, game outcomes and live feed information highlighting key events during the progression of individual games. For simplicities sake in this project I restricted the scope of analysis to focus solely on team performance per game, variables include:
*	Goals
*	PIM (Penalty minutes) 
*	Shots
*	Power Play % (Goals scored per Power Play Opportunity)
*	Power Play Goals
*	Power Play Opportunities 
*	Face Off Win Percentage   
*	Blocked (Shots from the opposing team blocked by a player reaching the goalie)
*	Takeaways (Intended turnover of possession from the opposing team)
*	Giveaways (Unintended turnover of possession to the opposing team)
*	Hits (Physical contact between opposing players resulting in the loss of possession by the opposite team member)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I undertook descriptive analysis of game features to better understand the data and to identify any trends which would be indicative of a teams success within a single game or over a period of successive games.

### Seasons

During the loading process of game data from the API a number of 404 errors were encountered indicating the specified game data was not available. We would expect to retrieve 1,230 games prior to the 2017 season and 1,371 2017 onwards (Las Vegas Golden Knights  entered the league in 2017). The missing games were especially prevalent for games in the 2012-13 season. The 2018-19 season at the time of analysis is underway, results are retrieved regularly and appended to the historical game dataset.

### Wins per season

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/KlNzwKdr8QX9" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

Excluding current 2018-19 and 2012-13 seasons the distribution of game win percentage centres slightly above 50%. League leaders will rarely hold a game wining average of above 64% and lower end teams can generally be expected to win two out of five games (40%) averaged over a season.

### Home Team Advantage?
Is there a significant difference for teams playing at their home arena compared to playing away?

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/cP22UwI6i0QR" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

There appears to be a very slight disadvantage to home teams, a home team in general would be expected to 51% of their away games and conversely 49% of their home games

Certain teams will perform better at home than others, illustrated below is the variance of home and away Win % from overall performance.

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/hXQWCBEpVPMo" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

Lets take a look at goals scored for home and away teams

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/L089afYFySCv" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

It appears that home teams score a higher number of goals per game more frequently than away teams, this would indicate a wider margin for home team wins than losses

By conducting a paired t-test on the distribution of home and away goals, we can establish if there is a statistically significant difference between the two populations

```python
#conduct a dependent t-test on home and away goals
from scipy import stats
stats.ttest_rel(goals['Home'], goals['Away'])
Ttest_relResult(statistic=11.135112011475373, pvalue=1.2859551452133143e-28)
```

The pvalue of the t-test being less than 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference home and away teams in respect of goals scored

### Corsi Stats

Lets look at shots (on goal, missed and blocked), a popular metric is the Corsi which compares shots for and against and can be represented as a integer or percentage

For example Team A have 66 shots on goal Team B have 55: 
Corsi Team A = 66-55 = 11 
Corsi Team A% = 66/(66+55) = 55% 
Corsi Team B = 55-66 = -11 
Corsi Team B% = 55/(66+55) = 45%

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/r1QzPCFSTvON" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

If we compare teams Win% and Corsi% we can see a correlating trend between the two, by calculating the correlation coefficient we see a moderate correlation between the two:

```python
from scipy.stats.stats import pearsonr
pearsonr(corsi_grouped['Corsi %'],corsi_grouped['Win %'])

(0.6184222739960428, 0.00020899389348708302)
(Coefficient, P value for testing of non-correlation)
```

## Elo Ranking

Elo scores were originally devloped as a chess ranking system and have since been deployed in various competitive enviroments including videogames and sports.

The concept behind this rating process in simplified terms is:
* Each team begins with the same score
* When a team wins they take a number of points from the opposing team
* Over the course of a season (or more), consistantly successful teams would accumulate a higher Elo rating and underperforming teams a lower Elo rating
* This rating can be used to calculate the probability of a win based on the variance of oppposing teams Elo scores

In the chart below we see the progression of Elo ratings for various teams

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/m8QBQfdZnfVt" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

Lets look at an example of Elo scores can be used to predict the outcome of a game:

Team A have a score of 1700
Team B have a score of 1450

```python
a_score = 1700
b_score = 1450

prob_a_win = 1/(1+10**((b_score - a_score)/400))

prob_a_win = 0.808317673

prob_b_win = 1 - prob_a_win

prob_b_win = 0.191682327
```

A coefficient K is used to calculate the number of points to be deducted from the losing team, this is multiplied by the prior probability of a team winning, so in cases where a favourite wins a smaller number of points are deducted from the losing team.

Lets imagine with the above scenario the favourite Team A won and coefficient K is set to 10:

```python
a_score = 1700
b_score = 1450

prob_a_win = 0.808317673

elo_change = k*(1-prob_a_win)

elo_change = 10*(1-0.808317673)

elo_change = 1.916823275
```

Conversely if Team B (the underdog) won:

```python
a_score = 1700
b_score = 1450

prob_b_win = 0.191682327

elo_change = k*(1-prob_b_win)

elo_change = 10*(1-0.191682327)

elo_change = 8.083176725
```

The value of K can be chosen by comparing the RMSE on predictions for each value of K

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/xf8kVli42hi5" width="600" height="400" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

An optimum K coefficient appears around a value of 6 or 7, we will apply this for prediciting upcoming games.

In the dashboard below I have applied the Elo model to upcoming games to provide a predicitve probability of wins and losses, I have alose included some of the KPI's common to NHL statistical analysis

<p align='center'><iframe src="https://ciarancarroll.clicdata.com/v/O9w3sL8fOWGD" width="760" height="1360" frameBorder="0"></iframe></p>

Over the course of the analysed period the Elo rating system has provided the greatest accuracy, while other models (SVC, Naive Bayes and Logistic regression) were somewhat close in predictive accuracy when assesed against a training test split, this accuracy was not reflected in live deployment.
